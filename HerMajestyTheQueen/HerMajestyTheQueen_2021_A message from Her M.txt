A message from Her Majesty The Queen to the President of Ireland, His Excellency Michael D Higgins 
Lá Fhéile Pádraig sona daoibh go léirOn the occasion of your National Day, I would like to convey to Your Excellency my congratulations, together with my best wishes to the people of Ireland. This year marks ten years since my visit to Ireland, which I remember fondly, and it marks a significant centenary across these islands. We share ties of family, friendship and affection – the foundation of our partnership that remains as important today as ten years ago.‘Lá Fhéile Pádraig sona daoibh go léir.’ [Happy St Patrick’s Day to you all]
