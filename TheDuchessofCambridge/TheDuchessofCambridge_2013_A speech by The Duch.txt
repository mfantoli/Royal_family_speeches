A speech by The Duchess of Cambridge at Action on Addiction, Manchester
The cycle of addiction needs to be broken. Thank you Anne, and to you all for such a warm welcome.Addiction is a hugely complex and destructive disease and its impact can be simply devastating. All too often, lives and families can be shattered by it.Through my Patronage of Action on Addiction, I feel fortunate to have met a wide range of inspirational people who have overcome addiction. It is so encouraging to see that with the right help - like that of Action on Addiction - it can be conquered.But those who are addicted are not the only victims. I have been struck by the profound and deeply damaging impact it has on the children of affected parents.Research has shown that children of those who are addicted are seven times more likely to have addiction problems themselves. They are also brought up surrounded by fear, instability and chaos.Last year, I asked The Royal Foundation, which I share with William and Harry, to see what could be done to help these children.In partnership with Comic Relief, our Foundation commissioned a piece of research to explore this issue. Today, it gives me an enormous feeling of pride and excitement to launch a programme that will bring this research to life.Place 2 Be delivers exceptional specialist counselling services in schools. Action on Addictionâ€™s MPACT programme delivers life changing and expert support to families affected by addiction.The Royal Foundation has simply brought these two outstanding charities together to deliver a programme that will ensure that many children living with addicted parents will be identified, supported and guided to look towards a positive and hopefully, addiction free future.I would like to thank The Royal Foundation for all that they have done to make this happen.Thank you also to Comic Relief, Place 2 Be and Action on Addiction for working so brilliantly with them.
