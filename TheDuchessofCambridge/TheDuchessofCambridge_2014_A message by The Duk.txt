A message by The Duke of Cambridge for the Evening Standard and The Independent's Homeless Veterans campaign
They would give their life to protect us, and they expect little in return.The men and women of the Armed Forces serve all of us with their lives when called upon by their country.  They would give their life to protect us, and they expect little in return.  The Armed Forces life is tough, it's unique, and it is also difficult sometimes to make the transition into civilian life afterwards.It troubles me deeply that our servicemen and women possess extraordinary courage, skills and talent, yet many find it difficult to gain meaningful employment in the civilian world and can fall on hard times.  We can all do something small but meaningful to give these anonymous heroes a helping hand, give them hope and put them on the right road to recovery.  It's a good cause to support.
