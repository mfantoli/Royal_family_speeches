A speech by The Duchess of Cambridge at the opening of V&A Dundee
I believe we should celebrate all our leading galleries, museums, and cultural centres playing a greater role in communities, not just in London, but up and down the country too.William and I are so pleased to be back here in Dundee to celebrate the opening of this wonderful museum today.  Thank you so much for inviting us.Last February, I was delighted to become Patron of The V&Ain London. Now, nearly a year later, I’m thrilled to be standing in a brand new V&A: one which has been built for the city of Dundee and for Scotland, and which is already picking up international awards.  In its first four months alone, it welcomed over three-hundred and sixty-thousand visitors – a truly remarkable feat.Walking around this world-class space, it’s easy to see how Scotland’s first dedicated design museum is already inspiring the next generation, by providing a new learning space for discovery.I have been captivated by the breath-taking architecture, and the sheer range of design on display.But most of all I’ve been moved by the passion of the people who work here, and the dedication of all those who have helped make this important project to succeed.I believe we should celebrate all our leading galleries, museums, and cultural centres playing a greater role in communities, not just in London, but up and down the country too. The cultural riches of the UK belong to all people of the UK.This is what V&A Dundee has achieved.  The partners involved in this project from the local area, Scotland, and the UK more broadly all deserve enormous credit for the way you have collaborated to make this happen.I hope that this Museum will serve as an inspiration to others, by showing how great things can be achieved when different communities all pull together. With this thought in mind, I am pleased to declare V&A Dundee ‘officially’ open.
