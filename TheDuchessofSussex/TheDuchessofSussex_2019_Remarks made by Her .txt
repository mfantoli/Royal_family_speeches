Remarks made by Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex at the Youth Employment Services, Johannesburg
There’s so much ingenuity here, there’s so much promise here, that given the right level of support and resources that you need, the potential is astronomical, and you can see that there.Following a speech by The Duke of Sussex The Duchess said:There is not much I can add to that, outside saying that on our last day here in South Africa, thank you all so much. As my husband said so eloquently, you really have been such an inspiration for us and being here today, from every level of what we’ve seen, there is such a holistic approach to how you have energised and mobilised each other to be part of a bigger change.And on a personal note seeing the work that’s being done at Blossom is incredible. I have worked with an organisation very similar, several years ago in India called Myna Mahila and being able to see that you’re creating a product that is needed within the community you’re be able to become the provider for – everything about the economy and what you need -  as opposed to getting it externally, you are feeding yourselves through that work and on top of which being able to enable these women to have the power to own the company is amazing.But that’s what is amazing and that’s what’s needed because there’s so much talent here.  There’s so much ingenuity here, there’s so much promise here, that given the right level of support and resources that you need, the potential is astronomical, and you can see that there. And I think for you women, I’m so proud of you and the business you’re creating, and also being able to now control your own purse strings, because when you have that level of independence, my goodness you can do anything.
