A speech by Prince William at the Annual Passing Out Parade at Hendon Police Training College, Hendon, London
I would like to say how much I admire you all for your dedication and application in successfully passing this course.Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen.It is an enormous privilege for me to be standing here taking the Salute at your Passing Out Parade. I have to say it is all a little too fresh in my mind – from being on your side of the fence at Sandhurst – for my knees not to be knocking very slightly, every time I look at you.I must say though that you have done yourselves proud, and all your instructors, this afternoon with your immaculate smartness and bearing on parade.I would like to say how much I admire you all for your dedication and application in successfully passing this course. I know that to attain the standards demanded by one of the world’s most famous and revered police forces, the Metropolitan Police, is, frankly, a fantastic achievement.Of course, as I found when I completed my own training at Sandhurst, this is just the beginning.   Ahead of you lie years of service to the people of this great city, which I am confident you will perform with the traditional flair and selfless devotion to duty of the Metropolitan Police.Wherever your paths lead there will remain an unbreakable link between all of you. That is a certainty, and it comes from, together, having met and overcome the considerable challenges you faced on this course.
