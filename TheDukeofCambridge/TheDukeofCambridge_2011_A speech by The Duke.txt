A speech by The Duke of Cambridge to mark a partnership between ARK and the Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry
Programmes from this partnership will raise aspirations, broaden horizons and encourage young people to achieve what may have seemed to them unachievable.I am delighted that this evening marks the start of a new joint-partnership between Absolute Return for Kids – A R K – and The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry and The Duchess of Cambridge – F P W P H A T D C…This new joint-partnership is based on our shared vision and commitment to transform the lives of thousands of young people.I know that I am very fortunate. I have had a good education, a secure home and a loving and supportive family. So many young people, however, do not have these advantages and, as a result, can lack the confidence and knowledge to realise their full potential.That is why I am so pleased that the Foundation and ARK are working together on this venture to help young people who really need it. Programmes from this partnership will raise aspirations, broaden horizons and encourage young people to achieve what may have seemed to them unachievable.With your help, ARK and the Foundation are committed to a four-year programme. It will generate opportunities in education for young people in the United Kingdom, and then later expand beyond our shores, initially to projects in sub-Saharan Africa.I count myself fortunate for another reason too. Harry and I find ourselves in a position to be able to help. I really believe that individuals can make a serious difference - whether it’s through wealth, through position, or some other advantage. It is so heartening to see that so many of you here tonight, through your commitment, share that belief.It is in this spirit that my brother, Catherine and I hope to use our philanthropy as a long-term catalyst for meaningful change.I am delighted that we are working with ARK, which has a proven track-record in changing for the better thousands of young people’s lives around the world. Together, we have tremendous potential to make a serious difference.
