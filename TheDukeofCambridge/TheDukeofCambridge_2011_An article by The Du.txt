An article by The Duke of Cambridge about SkillForce UK, The Telegraph
It is remarkable what these ex-Servicemen and women are able to achieve for these young people by working together with them, for their own good and for the benefit of us all.SkillForce: 'These men and women instil core values’These values, of course, are not only vital to the efficiency and professionalism of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force, but are intrinsic to the wellbeing of our nation, and are needed in society more than ever.That is why, as Patron of SkillForce, I am so delighted that the Telegraph has chosen us for its Christmas Appeal this year. SkillForce has developed a unique method for transferring the values and skills of our Servicemen and women to where they are perhaps most needed in wider society: to young people who don’t yet realise what they can achieve and who risk becoming detached from their studies. The charity’s large number of ex-military instructors work with these boys and girls, raising their confidence and self-belief to shape a sense of purpose in their lives and help them unlock their true potential.The approach is innovative. Teams of SkillForce instructors are embedded in the schools where help is most needed, focusing on those who face the toughest challenges in the classroom and at home. The charity mentors those who otherwise might play truant or be excluded, opening up fresh avenues for them, preparing them for the adult world and for employment.
