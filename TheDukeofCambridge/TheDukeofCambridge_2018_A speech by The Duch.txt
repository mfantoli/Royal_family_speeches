A speech by The Duchess of Cambridge at a Military Families' Christmas Reception, London
Not only are we grateful for you coming here to join our party, but also for the sacrifices you make on a daily basis on behalf of the nation.Hello everyone!I hope you’ve all been having a really fun time. It’s really lovely to see you all here.William and I just wanted to pass on our huge gratitude to all of you here today.Not only are we grateful for you coming here to join our party, but also for the sacrifices you make on a daily basis on behalf of the nation.As someone whose husband has served, I know how hard it feels when a loved one leaves home to do the job they’ve trained for.When William served in the Falklands or went search and rescue, I remember how it felt. But I can’t imagine how it feels when your loved ones are away on active service over Christmas or at those special family moments.The absence of people you love must be especially hard at this time of year.William and I, however, hope that today shows, in some small way, how much you are all valued.We should never forget our military families and all the service you do for us all.I’d like to say a quick thank you too to all of those people who have given their time to make this party happen.In particular, we are hugely grateful to the Royal British Legion, who have been terrific in supporting us today. They do so much to help military families every day of the year.
