An open letter written by The Duke of Cambridge to mark Air Ambulance Week 2020
 Your tireless dedication to saving lives and helping those in times of greatest need is a source of huge pride for our country.As we mark Air Ambulance Week 2020, I wanted to send my personal thanks to each and every member of the air ambulance community for the vital role you play in saving lives across the country every day.Having seen first-hand the incredible work of air ambulance teams both on the front line and behind the scenes, I hold a profound respect for all that you do.  Whether you are part of the critical care team bringing vital medical support to patients when every second counts; an engineer who ensures that crews can be safely deployed at a moment’s notice; or a volunteer working to keep the service running, the country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude.The outbreak of COVID-19 has presented an immeasurably difficult challenge to all emergency responders. You have had to adapt to new ways of working throughout the pandemic – while continuing to provide a crucial lifeline to those who need it most. However, I know from experience that a wonderful spirit runs through the air ambulance community and I encourage everyone to continue to take time to support one another through these difficult times.I also know that for an emergency service funded almost entirely by public donations, this will have been an unsettling period for you all as fundraising activities have been curtailed.  I am enormously grateful to all those who support the work of air ambulance services across the country - even through these most challenging of times.This Air Ambulance Week, more than ever, I am delighted to see a spotlight shone on the work of this community and all those who support you.  Your tireless dedication to saving lives and helping those in times of greatest need is a source of huge pride for our country.
