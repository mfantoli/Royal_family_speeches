A message from The Duke of Cambridge following the death of The Duke of Edinburgh
My grandfather’s century of life was defined by service – to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family.My grandfather’s century of life was defined by service – to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family.I feel lucky to have not just had his example to guide me, but his enduring presence well into my own adult life – both through good times and the hardest days. I will always be grateful that my wife had so many years to get to know my grandfather and for the kindness he showed her. I will never take for granted the special memories my children will always have of their great-grandpa coming to collect them in his carriage and seeing for themselves his infectious sense of adventure as well as his mischievous sense of humour!
