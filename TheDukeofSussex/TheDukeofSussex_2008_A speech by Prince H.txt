A speech by Prince Harry to open the Dolen Cymru Lesotho Exhibition, National Museum of Wales, Cardiff
The tapestries have been lent by individuals and organisations with a love of Lesotho from right across Wales.Prince Seeiso, First Minister, Foreign Minister, ladies and gentlemen.It gives me great pleasure to be here this evening to meet so many people with a shared love of Lesotho, and hopefully some of you who we can interest in the glorious Mountain Kingdom.Last year I was most honoured to become the patron of Dolen Cymru, the Wales – Lesotho link, which was the world’s first country twinning project, and is soon to celebrate its 25th birthday. Its role is to Save Lives, Build Skills and Create Links, aims which are very close to my heart after the unforgettable ten weeks I spent in Lesotho during my Gap year.I’d like to applaud the work of Dolen’s Chair, Wayne Crocker, and all those who’ve led and worked for the charity over the last 25 years.I would also like to offer my thanks to the Welsh Assembly Government for their commitment to Lesotho. I heard this morning, during my visit to the Cardiff and Vale Trust, of a new project funded by the Welsh Assembly Government’s Wales For Africa Programme. It’s run by Mencap Cymru and is designed to give people with a learning disability the opportunity to volunteer in Lesotho.
