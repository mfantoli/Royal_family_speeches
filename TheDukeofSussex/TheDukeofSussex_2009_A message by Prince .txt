A message by Prince William and Prince Harry for Armed Forces Day
They work selflessly with honour and distinction, in the most challenging circumstances imaginable. Armed Forces Day is a celebration of our fighting men and women, and the immeasurable contribution they make to our lives and to the reputation of this Country.Through centuries of service to the Nation, the members of our Armed Forces have established a record unequalled in the world. They work selflessly with honour and distinction, in the most challenging circumstances imaginable. As serving officers, we have the privilege of witnessing the living traditions, the courage and the professionalism at first hand. It is humbling for us to be associated, in a minor way, with something quite so exceptional.This day also recognises the wider family: the veterans, young and old; the many volunteers who support the Cadet Forces so tirelessly; and - of paramount importance and sometimes forgotten - the families and friends whose care and support enables such excellence.
