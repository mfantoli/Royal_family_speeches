A speech by Prince Harry at a Diamond Jubilee street naming ceremony in Belize
Let the party begin! "Mek wih go paaty" (in Kriol)Your Excellency, Mayor Lopez, Ladies and Gentlemen. Everyone with a flag!What a wonderful gathering! The Queen has spoken this year of the power of togetherness and the convening strength of family, friendship and good neighbourliness – this party says it all!Obviously, I bring to you warmest greetings from The Queen of Belize, whose Diamond Jubilee we are celebrating here tonight. Her Majesty has asked me to send her good wishes to you all. She remembers so fondly her visits to this beautiful realm and speaks of the warmth of welcome she received on her most recent visit in 1994. I'm only sorry she can't make it and you're stuck with me.  Looking round me tonight, I can see exactly what she means about this legendary Belizean welcome!When it became clear that I was to represent my Grandmother in Belize, my heart leapt - for a good reason. (Aside) The noisy corner here; and a bit more noise on this side, please.Because of the long association and friendship between Belize and Britain – and in particular the armed forces of the two countries - I’ve heard so much about this beautiful place. I can’t wait for tomorrow, when I’ll get the chance to meet more Belizeans and see something of your glorious natural and historical heritage.I even get to launch a canoe called the QEII using, quite rightly, a bottle of a certain well-known local brew though it seems an awful waste to use the best beer in the West.Thank you for inviting me here this evening, and for celebrating The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in such vigorous Belizean style.Though I am her grandson, I know I speak for everyone when I say, Your Majesty, you are an inspiration to us all. It, therefore, just remains for me to name this street ‘Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Boulevard’.
