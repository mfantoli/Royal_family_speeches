A speech by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry at the launch of Heads Together
Let's all get our heads together and let's change the conversation, from one of silence and shame to one of optimism and supportThe Duke of CambridgeThrough our work with young people, emergency response, homeless charities, and with veterans, we have seen time and time again that unresolved mental health problems lie at the heart of some of our greatest social challenges. The Duchess of CambridgeToo often, people feel afraid to admit that they are struggling with their mental health.  This fear of judgment stops people from getting the help they need, which can destroy families and end lives. 
	Heads Together wants to help everyone feel much more comfortable with their everyday mental wellbeing, and to have the practical tools to support their friends and family.Prince HarryThe Heads Together campaign wants to involve all of you.  We're already working with our partner charities and thousands of people to change the way that people think about mental health.  We do not want prejudice and fear to stand in the way of people getting the help they need to cope with life.  As the year progresses, the three of us – working with all of you in this room and others who join us along the way – want to come up with practical ways of providing everyone who needs help with the right support and care. 
	We want to build on the great work that others are already doing, but make it even more ambitious. 
	By putting our heads together, we can all make a big difference.The Duke of Cambridge
