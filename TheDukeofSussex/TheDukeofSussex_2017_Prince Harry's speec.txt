Prince Harry's speech at a reception to celebrate the impact of Heads Together
William, Catherine and I consider it a privilege to work with all of you.As William has said, we are incredibly grateful to all of you for your contribution to Heads Together. We wanted to invite you here to express our thanks in person for the success of the campaign.But while we are all here to mark what has been achieved, we all know that there is much more still to be done. All of you contributed to the first truly national conversation on mental health.All of you helped change the language around this issue, shifting away from fear and shame, to a more open and optimistic sense about what we can achieve when we simply start talking.All of you showed what is possible when we get our Heads Together.And now we need all of your expertise, all of your energy, and all of your enthusiasm to provide the tools and space for people to have conversations on mental health wherever they are.Our Royal Foundation has announced a £2 million investment to create a new digital start up that will develop solutions to help people get online support in times of crisis and times of calm as well.Yesterday we announced a new partnership with the Ministry of Defence that will see the entire defence community – service men and women, veterans, and the MoD civilian population – get better information and training on mental health and mental fitness.In the months ahead, we will announce new partnerships to support better conversations in schools and workplaces.All of this work is proving that two heads – or three, or four, or more – really are better than one. Our charity partners are constantly coming up with new ideas that are only possible through collaboration.When we work together, we are greater than the sum of our parts.And we can achieve extraordinary things.William, Catherine and I consider it a privilege to work with all of you.And we look forward to celebrating more Heads Together successes in the years ahead.And Happy World Mental Health Day.
